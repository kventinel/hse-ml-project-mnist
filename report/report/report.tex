\section*{Data}

For our project we get \href{http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/}{MNIST} dataset, that consists from $60000$ images of digits from $0$ to $9$ in train and $10000$ in test. From this images we randomly choose $1000$ images in train and $1000$ images in test. For each image in original dataset presents $28 \times 28$ features in range from $0$ to $255$ -- value of each pixel of image.

    \end{center}


We preprocess this image and get next features:
\begin{itemize}
            \item count -- count of nonzero pixels in image
            \item mean -- average value of pixels in image
            \item vert\_symmetry -- difference between mean of pixels in top half of image and bottom half of image
            \item hor\_symmetry -- difference between mean of pixels in right half of image and bottom half of image
            \item vert\_mass\_center -- weighted mean of pixels by this \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass}{equation}, where wight of pixel -- it is index of row with this pixel
            \item hor\_mass\_center -- weighted mean of pixels by this \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass}{equation}, where wight of pixel -- it is index of column with this pixel
\end{itemize}
And 3 features received using filters \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violaâ€“Jones_object_detection_framework}{Viola-Jones}:
\begin{itemize}
        \item vert\_viola -- difference between (mean of pixels in top 7 and bottom 7 rows) and (mean of pixels in center 14 rows)
        \item hor\_viola -- difference between (mean of pixels in left 7 and right 7 columns) and (mean of pixels in center 14 columns)
        \item all\_viola -- difference between (mean of pixels in top left quarter and right bottom quarter) and (mean of pixels in top right quarter and bottom left quarter)
\end{itemize}

We have got this dataset, because it's very common dataset for all machine learning courses and articles. And we were interesting to know more different facts about patterns in this dataset.
